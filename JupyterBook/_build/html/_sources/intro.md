# Conference Tutorials

This is a collection of tutorials that have been prepared for various NMR conferences and schools. I have started collecting these tutorials into a webpage as of 2025, but older examples may be found in the GitHub repository [link](https;//github.com/alsinmr/ConferenceExamples). Also check out our software packages, [SLEEPY](http://sleepy-nmr.org) and [pyDIFRATE](https://alsinmr.github.io/pyDR).

Please [get in touch](https://biophysik.medizin.uni-leipzig.de/research/dr-albert-a-smith-penzel/) if you have questions, etc.
