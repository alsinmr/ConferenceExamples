Alternatively, we can leave the tumbling in both simulations, but then we need to be sure the overall motion in MD is accurate, otherwise it will be a major source of error. On the other hand, for molecules like lipids in membranes, usually we want to keep the overall motion and so will not perform an alignment step. For intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), the overall motion presents a particular challenge because it can be hard to reproduce, but it is also not really possible to separate internal from overall motion in IDPs.\n",

When an atom reaches the end of the box, it does not interact with a wall or a vacuum, but rather it interacts with atoms on the opposite side of the box. This is a convenient trick for keeping realistic interactions without requiring an extremely large system. However, a molecule may well be split across the box. This does not impact the simulation in any negative way, but makes the direction of a bond ill-defined. One may either prepare the simulation before analysis such that the molecule of interest stays \"whole\" or \"centered\", both usually avoid this problem. Alternatively, one may correct for bonds split across the box during analysis (pyDR, which we use later, treats the PBC automatically. It does not automatically handle alignment)."
